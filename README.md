- 👋 Hi, I’m @ReggyB...transitioning to tech from operations. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning frontend development. Currently building my technical writing skills and network. I would appreciate all the tips and network community links that I can get. I previously worked full-time in operations with transferable project management skills and volunteered as an editor/contributing writer. Basic familiarity with digital marketing, Hubspot, and SM management tools. 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sharing tools, tips, and resources to help me become fully "tech-ified" in 6 months.
